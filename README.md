Npm commands:


`npm start` - runs the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode".

`npm run build` - runs the TypeScript compiler once.

`npm run build:w` - runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode; the process keeps running, awaiting changes to TypeScript files and re-compiling when it sees them.

`npm run serve` - runs the server.
