We've captured many of the most useful commands in npm scripts defined in the package.json:

npm start - runs the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode".
npm run build - runs the TypeScript compiler once.
npm run build:w - runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode; the process keeps running, awaiting changes to TypeScript files and re-compiling when it sees them.
npm run serve - runs the lite-server, a light-weight, static file server, written and maintained by John Papa and Christopher Martin with excellent support for Angular apps that use routing.
